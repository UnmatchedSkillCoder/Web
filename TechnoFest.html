        <p>Every year almost every engineering college in India organizes TechFest - an event comprising of technical events, competitions, paper presentation competitions, seminar presentations and so on.
            The events also open a large number of opportunities to students to attend these fests, get updates about the latest in engineering and technology and also present newer ideas to engineering audience.
            </br>
            Organizing a tech-fest is also a great challenge to the organizers as they've to come up with new ideas and events. It's not at all an easy task.
            </br>
            We picked up this issue where our engineers from various backgrounds and countries brainstormed about various technical ideas that could become a part of techfest. We've come up with really interesting and innovative ideas.
            </br>
            If you're not satisfied with the ideas discussed in that discussion thread, feel free to ask for more. I'm sure all our engineers would be happy to help you.
